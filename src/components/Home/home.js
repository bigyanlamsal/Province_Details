                         Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal.[a] The precise origin of the term NepƒÅl is uncertain. Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century BC.[which?] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages.[19]
